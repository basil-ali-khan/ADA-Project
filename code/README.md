# GAGAN: Generative Adversarial Network with Genetic Algorithms

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) enhanced with Genetic Algorithms (GAGAN) for image generation. 
The generator creates images from random noise, while a population of discriminators evolves using genetic operations like crossover and mutation to improve their 
ability to distinguish real and fake images.
