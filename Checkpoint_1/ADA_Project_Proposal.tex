\section*{Summary}
This paper presents \textbf{GAGAN}, a hybrid approach that enhances \textbf{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)} by integrating \textbf{Genetic Algorithms (GAs)} to optimize the discriminator's weights. Traditional \textbf{Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)} often suffer from training instability and mode collapse. By incorporating evolutionary techniques like crossover and mutation, GAGAN improves convergence stability and image quality. The model was tested on the \textbf{CelebA dataset}, generating high-quality \textbf{128 Ã— 128 images}. The results showed lower generator loss and better image fidelity compared to standard DCGANs.

\section*{Justification}
This paper is highly relevant to our project because:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It explores a novel \textbf{hybrid learning} approach that combines \textbf{deep learning} and \textbf{evolutionary algorithms}.
    \item It tackles key challenges in \textbf{GAN training} (mode collapse, instability), making it crucial for advancing generative models.
    \item The integration of \textbf{Genetic Algorithms} in \textbf{deep learning} is an emerging research area with real-world applications in \textbf{image generation} and \textbf{AI creativity}.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Implementation Feasibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code \& Resources:} The paper does not mention a public implementation, but we plan to implement the genetic algorithms ourselves and using built-in libraries for the neural network training part as discussed in the meeting with our instructor.
    \item \textbf{Datasets:} The CelebA dataset is publicly available and can be used for training. However, we might preferably choose to use another publicly available dataset
    \item \textbf{Computational Requirements:} Training GANs requires \textbf{high-end GPUs}, hence we will be using Google Colab for this project.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Team Responsibilities}
We plan to divide work equally at every stage. Since Ahsan has previously worked in this domain, he will be taking the lead in the implementation stage.
